# cardmaker — Das Experten Marketplace Card Generator

> Formerly **productcardmaker**. Inter-skill calls via [[GATE: cardmaker]] — the legacy gate name [[GATE: productcardmaker]] resolves here too.

Generates a single, copy-paste ready ultra-photorealistic product card image prompt.
No structured text output. No bullets. No JSON. One prompt block — then rendered via the OpenRouter image API (nano-pro). No imager gate, no other image platforms.

Lives inside the Das Experten system — inherits all brand defaults, clinical data,
ingredient knowledge, and product identities automatically.

---

## TRIGGER WORDS (fire immediately, no confirmation needed)

Any product name or SKU + marketplace context:
- "карточка", "карточку", "card", "listing", "листинг"
- Platform names: "Ozon", "Озон", "Amazon", "Shopee", "Noon", "international", "WB", "ВБ", "Wildberries", "Вайлдберриз"
- Any Das Experten SKU alone: DE201, DE206, DE117, DE131, DE310, etc.

---

## STAGE 0 — MANDATORY BRAND KNOWLEDGE LOAD

Before doing anything else — before product identification, before format detection, before generating anything — read the full **product-skill** skill: its `SKILL.md` plus `references/` (sku-cards, ingredients).

Read both files completely. Extract and hold in context for the requested product:
- Full ingredient list with concentrations
- All clinical numbers and study data
- Core mechanism of action
- Ideal user profiles
- Brand voice rules and prohibited phrases
- Any product-specific positioning notes

Only after full extraction — proceed to Stage 0.5.

## STAGE 0.5 — Product Knowledge Gate ⛔ MANDATORY

Run the Product Knowledge Gate built into product before any content generation.

→ [[GATE: product-knowledge]]
  INPUT: product name, article number, key ingredient + benefit, clinical stat, target condition/user, competitive advantage — all extracted from Stage 0
  AWAIT: GATE_RESULT

**On GATE_RESULT:**
- PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS → proceed to Stage 1 using the Corrected Knowledge Block
- FAIL → output exactly one line to user: "Product data adjusted for accuracy — proceeding with verified version." Then proceed to Stage 1 using the Corrected Knowledge Block
- All on-card copy (callouts, stats, headlines, evidence bubbles) uses the Corrected Knowledge Block only — never raw extracted data

⛔ Do not proceed to Stage 1 until GATE_RESULT is received.

---

## STAGE 2B — BRUSH ZOOM MODULE ⚡ AUTO-FIRES ON BRUSH PRODUCTS

**Trigger:** Product identified in Stage 1 is any toothbrush SKU (DE101, DE105, DE106, DE107, DE116, DE117, DE119, DE120, DE122, DE130, DE131, or any brush by name).

**If product is NOT a brush — skip this stage entirely. Proceed to Stage 3.**

**If product IS a brush — this module locks the composition before anything else.**

---

### COMPOSITION LOCK — BRUSH ZOOM STANDARD

COMPOSITION RULE: Never split the card into two separate halves. Always render as one unified cinematic scene with depth-of-field layering — brush head in foreground sharp, character and atmosphere in background bokeh. No hard left/right divide.

```
Dual-focus composition:
- LEFT SIDE → Character (if included) or text block
- RIGHT SIDE → Extreme macro zoom of toothbrush head at 80% visual weight
- OVERALL MOOD → Set by Product Mood Table below
```

### Hero Visual — Brush Head Zoom (mandatory for all brush cards)

- Extreme macro zoom — brush head fills 80% of the right side of the frame
- Brush head angled slightly toward the viewer — never flat/straight-on
- Bristle zone fully visible — no occlusion by hand, character, or text
- Each filament rendered in obsessive detail:
  - Micro-tapered tips visible
  - Material infusion visible (charcoal, gold-ion, silicone, etc. — per product)
  - Micro-spacing between bristle clusters visible
  - Subtle translucency at filament tips
- Micro-specular highlights on individual bristle tips catching light like fiber optics
- Shallow depth of field: bristles in razor focus, background softly bokeh-blurred

**Hero product fidelity block — insert verbatim into final prompt:**
> Hero product(s) = exact user-uploaded photo(s). Ultra-photorealistic, agency-level, zero geometry/label/color/proportion changes. Perfect fidelity on gloss, cap reflections, material texture, label clarity. Seamless micro-shadows and ground reflections.

---

### Product Mood Table — apply to overall card atmosphere

| Brush | Mood | Key Visual Energy |
|---|---|---|
| SCHWARZ brush | Predatory, intense, raw | Dark, dramatic, cinematic |
| ETALON brush | Clean, precise, clinical | White/silver, minimal, scientific |
| GROSSE brush | Powerful, full-coverage | Bold, wide, energetic |
| ZERO brush | Precision, orthodontic | Tight, focused, technical |
| NANO MASSAGE brush | Gentle, family, soft | Warm, soft light, approachable |
| AKTIV brush | Ultra-soft, delicate | Pastel-adjacent, soft shadows |
| SENSITIV brush | Safe, enamel-care | Clean white, calm, trusted |
| MITTEL brush | Workhorse, stain removal | Mid-tone, confident, direct |
| KRAFT brush | Aggressive, heavy-duty | Dark, industrial, strong |
| INTENSIV brush | Dense, ultra-clean | Deep blue/white, clinical |
| 3D brush | Dynamic, multi-angle | Motion-implied, energetic |

---

### 3D Technological Visual — Brush-Specific Options

Select based on product technology. Insert into Central Visual block of the final prompt:

| Brush | 3D Visual |
|---|---|
| SCHWARZ brush | Activated carbon micro-honeycomb lattice / charcoal fiber cross-section / stain absorption particle field |
| GROSSE brush | Au⁺ gold-ion antibacterial particle cloud |
| ETALON brush | 360° spiral PBT filament cross-section schematic |
| NANO MASSAGE brush | NanoFlex™ silicone micro-bubble + nano-silver integration visualization |

| 3D brush | Dual-beam metal core + 3D bristle tier schematics, motion-implied trajectory paths |
| MITTEL brush | PowerTouch™ multi-zone cross-section, plaque-contact pressure zones |

---

### BRUSH GRIP LOCK — AUTO-FIRES when character is present

When a character is included in the brush card, insert this verbatim block into the final prompt — no shortening, no paraphrasing:

> GRIP LOCK: Character holds the referenced toothbrush in exact realistic grip — thumb pad presses firmly on mid-body near head for controlled hold, index and middle fingers wrap partially around handle opposite thumb creating natural pinch, ring finger supports lower curve, pinky relaxed with light contact near base. Palm cups lower handle for stability, slight wrist flexion toward camera, natural finger curves, moderate pressure causing subtle volumetric deformation on handle walls, realistic muscle tension in thenar eminence and forearm flexors, correct joint angles — no hyperextension, gravity-consistent natural droop of wrist. Brush head fully visible beyond fingers, no occlusion of bristle zone, clear bristle detail and color visible.

Skip Grip Lock ONLY if user explicitly says: "separate", "отдельно", "product standing", "no contact", or clear equivalent.

---

### Text Rules for Brush Cards

- No English words in visible card copy — abbreviations only (PBT, Au⁺, RDA, etc.)
- All copy in Russian by default unless user specifies otherwise
- Left-aligned text block
- Disclaimer always bottom right: `Реклама. ООО "Дас Экспертен Евразия", ИНН 9704117379`

---

**After locking composition via this module — proceed to Stage 3 (Photo Check). The brush-zoom composition overrides the default OZON/International layout for the hero visual portion only. Layout zones (title, content, evidence bubble) remain per Stage 3B-VIZ.**

---

## STAGE 3 — PRODUCT PHOTO CHECK

**If user uploaded a product photo:** use it. No questions.
**If no photo uploaded:** remove hero product render entirely. Expand central molecular/material visual to dominant size (~85–90% width). Central visual carries full product narrative.

---

## STAGE 3A — CHARACTER DECISION

Ask the user exactly this:

"Do we include character(s)? Reply with a number (e.g. 1, 2, 3) or No."

If the user replies No / skips: proceed without character.
If the user replies with a number — AUTO-INSERT RULE:
⚠️ NEVER ask any follow-up questions about the character (age, gender, appearance, style, etc.).
⚠️ NEVER ask user to upload photos.
⚠️ NEVER summarize, shorten, or paraphrase the CHARACTER block below.
Replace [number] with the user's number and insert the full block EXACTLY as written — copy-paste only, zero modifications:

Character(s) = [number] reference close-up headshot (or half-body) shot(s) uploaded by user — exact facial features preserved: identical structure, eye shape / color / asymmetry / iris pattern / sclera tone / crease structure / interpupillary distance, nose contour / deviation, lip form with duchenne smile, eyebrow arch / thickness, hairline / parting, skin tone + all imperfections (freckles, fine lines), cheekbones, jawline, neck/shoulders. Integrate naturally into continuous ultra-photoreal scene with perfect perspective, DOF, grain, occlusion, contact shadows, no copy-paste feeling or cutout edges. Facial expression free to change, ensuring every edit fully matches and blends with the entire scene context.
CHARACTER OUTFIT — Outfit and styling must always match the scene context. If the scene setting implies a specific dress code (spa, beach, sport, clinical, etc.), character clothing must reflect that environment exactly — never default to neutral everyday clothing. AI must adapt wardrobe to scene, not scene to wardrobe. Outfit must feel native — never transplanted.
CHARACTER CROP — head-to-chest maximum, never full body. Crop optimized per layout: tight enough for expression, wide enough for GRIP LOCK to read naturally.

Specify natural actions explicitly (e.g. Character 1 observing/pointing at main 3D visualization, Character 2 discussing with Character 1, Character 3 holding/examining product element). Place characters interacting naturally in a logical real-life scene; allow natural interaction with main 3D visualizations (observing, picking, touching, pinching, pointing at, surrounded by molecular/tech elements). Use strong bokeh background for depth and focus when it enhances the scene.

### GRIP LOCK RULE — DEFAULT ON

Whenever a character and the hero product appear in the same scene, Grip Lock fires automatically. No detection needed — if there is a character and a product, the character is holding it. This is the default.

The only exception: user explicitly uses one of these opt-out signals — "separate", "отдельно", "независимо", "product standing", "продукт стоит", "product floating separately", "product on shelf", "character not holding it" — or any clear equivalent. In that case — and only that case — skip Grip Lock.

Identify the product type present in the scene and append the matching grip block below verbatim. No summarization. No shortening.

**Toothbrush only:**
Referenced product(s) must 100% match reference(s): exact branding / logos / colors / texts / shape / proportions / reflections / textures. Toothbrush length is exactly 17 cm. The referenced person has a Duchene smile, holding the referenced toothbrush fully visible without covering face or obstructing smile, toothbrush positioned laterally ~12–13 cm from lips. She/He holds the toothbrush in exact precision grip of the upper part of the toothbrush handle: thumb pad firmly presses top of handle ~2–3 cm from head (near neck), index finger extends straight along top for primary control, middle finger curls strongly underneath providing main support and opposition, ring finger wraps around mid-lower handle with moderate pressure, pinky relaxed/light touch near tail. Handle gripped ~4–5 cm from bristle tips, palm facing slightly upward, wrist neutral, fingers show natural flexion curves, realistic muscle tension, correct joint angles (MCP/PIP/DIP), light-moderate pressure, no hyperextension or strain, gravity-consistent droop. Tail (rounded base) fully visible beyond pinky/ring fingers.

**Toothbrush + Toothpaste Tube:**
Referenced product(s) must 100% match reference(s): exact branding / logos / colors / texts / shape / proportions / reflections / textures. Toothbrush length is exactly 17 cm. The referenced person has a Duchene smile, holding the referenced toothbrush fully visible without covering face or obstructing smile, toothbrush positioned laterally ~12–13 cm from lips. Right hand precision grip: thumb pad and index finger press top/side near neck for control, middle finger supports underneath, ring/pinky relaxed/light contact, natural curl, light pressure, correct joints/tension/gravity, no distortion; bristles fully visible facing viewer with close detailed focus on head, bristle arrangement, paste texture, exact positioning. Left hand holds a 15.5 cm toothpaste tube in exact realistic grip matching reference: thumb pad presses firmly on mid-body near cap for controlled expulsion, index and middle fingers wrap partially around tube opposite thumb creating pinch/squeeze, ring finger supports lower curve, pinky relaxed / light contact near base. Palm cups bottom for stability, slight wrist flexion, natural finger curves, moderate pressure causing localized volumetric deformation (tube walls indent inward), realistic muscle tension in thenar eminence and forearm flexors, correct joint angles (no hyperextension), gravity-consistent droop. Tail/base fully visible beyond pinky/ring fingers, no occlusion, clear edge and color transition.

**Toothpaste Tube only:**
Referenced product(s) must 100% match reference(s): exact branding / logos / colors / texts / shape / proportions / reflections / textures. Referenced toothpaste tube length is exactly 15 cm. The referenced person has a Duchene smile, holding the referenced 15.5 cm toothpaste tube in exact realistic grip matching reference: thumb pad presses firmly on mid-body near cap for controlled expulsion, index and middle fingers wrap partially around tube opposite thumb creating pinch/squeeze, ring finger supports lower curve, pinky relaxed / light contact near base. Palm cups bottom for stability, slight wrist flexion, natural finger curves, moderate pressure causing localized volumetric deformation (tube walls indent inward), realistic muscle tension in thenar eminence and forearm flexors, correct joint angles (no hyperextension), gravity-consistent droop. Tail/base fully visible beyond pinky/ring fingers, no occlusion, clear edge and color transition.

## STAGE 3B-VIZ — CENTRAL 3D / TECHNOLOGICAL VISUAL RULES

The central 3D visualization must always follow these integration rules regardless of which visual family is selected:

- Occupies 60–70% of background canvas behind character and product
- NOT a bubble, NOT a frame, NOT a schematic insert, NOT a floating object
- Seamless full-bleed background layer — no borders, no circles, no containers
- Depth of field creates natural bokeh fade at edges, blending organically with dark background
- Lit independently with cooler temperature to create separation from warm foreground
- Opacity and blur calibrated so visualization is clearly readable but never competes with hero product, character, or typography
- The visualization breathes freely behind the entire scene

The central 3D visual must be:
- Photorealistic, clinical or scientific in tone
- High complexity — not decorative or abstract
- Placed behind, beside, or subtly around the product and character
- ~75% width when product and/or character is present; larger when both are absent

Multiple visual families may be combined when it strengthens the narrative.

## STAGE 4 — GENERATE THE PROMPT

Output: one single copy-paste image-generation prompt block.
No preamble. No explanation. No headers. No bullets outside the prompt.
Just the prompt — start to finish — ready to paste.

---

### PROMPT ARCHITECTURE

#### OPENING LINE (always verbatim, adapt format only)

**Ozon:**
`Create an ultra-photorealistic agency-level 3×4 vertical marketplace product card for [PRODUCT NAME], featuring...`

**WB (Wildberries):**
`Create an ultra-photorealistic agency-level 3×4 vertical marketplace product card for [PRODUCT NAME], featuring...`

**International:**
`Create an ultra-photorealistic agency-level 1×1 square marketplace product card for [PRODUCT NAME], featuring...`

---

#### HERO PRODUCT BLOCK (always verbatim when photo uploaded)

```
Hero product = the product photo uploaded by user — exactly ultra-photorealistic, agency-level, high-fidelity, ultra-sharp render. No redraw / re-model / substitute packshot. No label, color, proportion, or geometry changes. Only realistic lighting integration: micro-shadows + reflections. Position: center-bottom-right, dominant, slightly forward. Crisp micro-shadows, crisp edges, premium cleanliness. If handle is cropped in source image — preserve that crop exactly, do not extend or reconstruct.
```

**No photo version:** Replace with: `No standalone product render. Central molecular/material visualization dominant (~85–90% width), carrying full product narrative.`

---

#### LAYOUT ZONES

**OZON 3×4:**

```
TITLE ZONE (top, ~35% width): Clean background with lighting continuity. No overlapping molecules or callouts. Subtle ambient gradient only. Space visually prepared for product title overlay.

CENTRAL VISUAL (~75% width): [MOLECULAR/MATERIAL VISUAL — see selection rules below]. Ultra-photorealistic, 8K, clinical-biotech aesthetic. Placed behind and beside the hero product. Reinforces the product's core mechanism visually.

LEFT CONTENT ZONE (~25% width): 3–4 scientific benefit callouts. Each with ALL-CAPS title (1–3 words, bold) + 1-line description + optional stat. No flat icons — all markers must be biotech schematics, anatomical callouts, or molecular bubbles. 2–4 thin biotech pointer lines toward product and molecular zones.

EVIDENCE BUBBLE: One glowing callout bubble with top clinical stat, connected by thin medical line to the hero product or molecular zone.
```

**INTERNATIONAL 1×1:**

```
CENTERED HERO PRODUCT: dominant, centered, slightly angled. Clean premium background.

TOP TEXT ZONE: Product name + 1 headline benefit. Clean typography, no clutter.

BOTTOM TEXT ZONE: 2 key stats or benefits. Compact, high-contrast, clinical tone.

BACKGROUND MOLECULAR ELEMENT: Subtle, integrated, reinforces product category. Not dominant — supporting role only. 30–40% opacity fade at edges.

BADGE (optional): One circular or pill-shaped callout with top clinical stat.

- Text color = active palette accent +2–3 tones darker for legibility

#### CLOSING QUALITY LINE (always append verbatim)

```
Ultra-photorealistic, 8K, agency-level, hyper-clean, crisp edges, premium laboratory lighting, micro-shadows, zero noise, zero artifacting.
```

---

## STAGE 5 — OUTPUT FORMAT

Deliver the prompt as one clean block of text.
No markdown headers inside the prompt.
No explanation before or after — just the prompt, copy-paste ready.

After delivering, output exactly one line:

`Card prompt ready. Platform: [Ozon 3×4 / International 1×1]. Language: [language]. Need a different palette, platform, or language?`

## STAGE 6 — RENDER VIA GOOGLE IMAGEN 4 ⛔ SINGLE ALLOWED BACKEND

All image generation for this skill runs through the **Google Imagen 4 API** directly — never OpenRouter, never the imager gate, never Higgsfield.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Endpoint | `POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/imagen-4.0-generate-001:predict?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| Model | `imagen-4.0-generate-001` — Imagen 4 Standard ($0.04/image) |
| Auth | `?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY` query param (key lives in SECRETS/gemini.md — never echo, never fabricate) |
| Request body | `{"instances":[{"prompt":"<Stage 4 prompt>"}],"parameters":{"sampleCount":1,"aspectRatio":"3:4"}}` |
| Aspect | Ozon/WB → `"aspectRatio":"3:4"` · International → `"aspectRatio":"1:1"` |
| Output | base64 image in `predictions[0].bytesBase64Encoded` — decode, save to outputs, present to user |

Imagen 4 renders photorealistic product scenes at studio quality. For multilingual on-card text (Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic) — embed text as part of the prompt description; Imagen 4 handles native text rendering.

**Fallback:** if the Google API call fails, deliver the Stage 4 prompt block to the user unchanged and say it is ready for manual generation. Never substitute another engine.
